# Dynamic Bounties
****Dynamic Bounties lets players place bounties on anyone, creating a fully player-driven PvP economy.****

- Any player can become a Bounty Host by placing a bounty on a target.

- The target remains the same until someone kills them, and the bounty is automatically paid to the killer, directly from the host’s EcoVault balance — even if it goes negative.

- The identity of the bounty host is always secret, keeping gameplay mysterious and competitive.

- Players can cancel their bounties anytime before they are claimed.

- View all active bounties with /bounty list or check individual bounty amounts with /bounty info <player> (host remains hidden).

- Track top performers with leaderboards:

1. ****/bounty top money**** — players who have earned the most via bounties.

2. ****/bounty top kills**** — players who have killed the most bounty targets.

## Key Features:

- Fully anonymous bounty system

- Automatic payout on kill — no items or heads required

- Negative balances allowed for bounty hosts

- Player-driven economy interaction with Dynamic EcoVault

- Top leaderboard tracking for money and kills

- Simple, lightweight, and fun for SMP and PvP servers

****Dynamic Bounties is perfect for servers that want purposeful PvP, rivalry, and player-driven competition, all while keeping the system simple and fair.****
